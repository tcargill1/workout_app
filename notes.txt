Goal of workout app:
To store reps, sets, and exercises for each day
Track PRs and review previous workouts
Each workout session includes title, date, and name of session (Push Day, Pull day, etc)
Each exercise includes name of exercise, muscle group, sets, reps, and weight done

The menu should look like: 
Log workout button, review previous workouts button, and exit
when logging workout, you will create a new session or edit a previous session
when creating a new session, ask for name of session for title and it will record the date
then click the + button to add an exercise, when adding an exercise you can add muscle group,
sets, reps, and weight
# there is also an exit button to go to previous page, when editing previous session you can click
# on exercises to edit them or add new exercises (same with creating a session)
# Layout should look like one line per exercise in a page for a session with PRS highlighted
# red highlighted if you need to work more on a certain exercise (no progess from either weight
# or sets)

# When creating the app, ask the user for their name and age to register before seeing the menu
